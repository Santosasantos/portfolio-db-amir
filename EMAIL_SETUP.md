## Email Details

The email sent includes:

- **Subject**: "New Contact Form Submission - Amir Hossen Portfolio"
- **From**: Portfolio Contact <onboarding@resend.dev>
- **To**: rabiul.personalinfo@gmail.com
- **Content**: Professional HTML template with:
  - Sender's full name
  - Sender's email address
  - Message content

## Important Notes

### Why use onboarding@resend.dev?

Resend's test email `onboarding@resend.dev` is pre-verified and works immediately without domain setup. This means:

- ✅ Works right away with just an API key
- ✅ No domain verification needed
- ✅ Perfect for portfolios and small projects

### Want to use a custom domain?

If you want emails to come from your own domain (e.g., `contact@yourdomain.com`):

1. Add your domain in Resend dashboard
2. Verify DNS records
3. Update the `from` field in `/app/api/contact/route.ts`

## Component Structure

- **`/app/api/contact/route.ts`** - API route handler that sends emails via Resend
- **`/components/contact-form.tsx`** - Reusable contact form component with state management
- **`/app/contact/page.tsx`** - Contact page using ContactForm component
- **`/app/page.tsx`** - Home page with embedded ContactForm component

## Troubleshooting

### Email not sending?

1. **Check API key**: Verify `RESEND_API_KEY` is set correctly in environment variables
2. **Check console**: Look for error logs in the browser developer console
3. **Check spam folder**: Initial emails might land in spam
4. **Verify Resend account**: Make sure your Resend account is active

### "403 validation_error" - Domain not verified?

This happens if you try to send from an unverified custom domain. Solution:
- Use `onboarding@resend.dev` as the `from` address (already set)
- Or verify your custom domain in Resend dashboard

### Form not submitting?

1. **Check network tab**: Look for failed API requests to `/api/contact`
2. **Verify all fields**: Ensure name, email, and message are filled
3. **Check browser console**: Look for JavaScript errors

### Rate limiting?

Resend free tier includes:
- 100 emails per day
- 3,000 emails per month
